# 🚀 Code Guidelines

## 👋 Introduction
This is a complete guide to write clean code in my style. These guidelines will be enforced in almost all of my projects and are applicable to almost every language. Initially, they are based on my code style in typescript. Please note that this is not the golden standard! This is how I like to write - in my eyes -  clean code, and should only function as a reference for both myself and others working on projects with me.
